If you're anything like me, procrastination is a major difficulty in life. Right now I'm suffering a severe bout courtesy of my upcoming thesis defense. In fact, in this very moment I am writing this post instead of working on it. In facter, while writing this line I rechecked my propsed defense dates and realized that at best I have twelve days and at worst less than a week! joy to the world.
