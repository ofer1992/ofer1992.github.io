<h1>Yiddish page</h1>
<h2>Resources for the initiated</h2>
<p>I have been learning yiddish since May 2021. My study up until now (November 2021) consisted of Duolingo, Anki for memorizing the words and weekly conversations with my grandma, who knows German and some Yiddish. We would also sometimes read childrens stories. Now that I am done with the Duolingo course I want to expand to reading and listening, but still some things are harder than others. I hope to collect in this page resources, and also offer some difficulty grading.

<h3>Dictionaries</h3>
<ul>
        <li><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page">Wiktionary</a>: Pretty good, but many words are missing</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.iddish.co.il/Dictionary.aspx">Dictionary in Hebrew</a>: Contains a lot of words but sometimes not clear, also suggestions are not ordered by how common they are which can be annoying.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.cs.uky.edu/~raphael/yiddish/dictionary.cgi">Another one</a>: This one is in english but is a little confusing. Also often doesn't display the hebrew writing of words.</li>
        <li>Dictionary by Uriel Weinreich: This one is an actual book. Obviously the most reliable and rich option, but without the luxury of internet dictionaries.</li>
</ul>

Maybe I can do some kind of time flow with resources at different times.
