<p>I set out on a quest a few months ago. Frustrated by my ignorance in other sciences as an "educated" man, a feeling lurking within me for several years now, I finally took a serious initiative , attacking it in two fronts. The first was listening to an introductory biology course and taking flashcards, as I mentioned in the past. This has been slowly but quite steadily moving along , and I'm so far happy with the results. The other prong was physics, that oh so elusive maiden. In the past I naively thought that now that I know the math, learning physics would be easy, but I was sorely mistaken. Learning physics, as a physicst would, means letting go of many mathematical habits. Essentially it is a different way of thinking and approaching problems.</p>
<p>I couldn't bear to go through the wordy and mathematically slim tomes of introductory physics used by many universities today. I prefer to learn something narrower but learn it well and deeper. It seemed like classical mechanics was the assumed beginning, and I found a great book that seemed to fit perfectly, introduction to mechanics by kleppner and kolenkow. It had the rare combination of assuming basically no physical knowledge, a fearless (as in fear of the teacher from the students' rage) use of mathematics and still a physical approach to problem solving. And so I set on studying the book.</p>
<p>The challenge of reading a textbook cover to cover is, it's a slow endeavor. The estimated reading pace is a couple of pages an hour. Go faster and you are usually deceiving yourself. This also does not include doing exercises, which are of course necessary and are also demanding time wise. In uni you have a course and you have obligations and grades, and this creates an external pressure on you to study, which is very helpful, even if annoying. </p>
<p>Anyway, I set a habit of reading each morning for around 45 minutes. I tried to review and recall stuff regularly, and I tried to do exercises, though not systematically, as I always felt pulled away by the desire to learn more material. I often used the examples a s exercises with solution though. I found that I couldn't study new material more than an hour or two a day, before it began to feel like a chore, so I figured it's better for it be relatively enjoyable and slow then a chore and collapsed.</p>
<p>I also spent a lot of time thinking about studying, for example, what's my progress, what's the plan, where will I be in a few weeks, what should I skip, what will be the next book etc. There was something obsessive compulsive about it, and I would often chastise myself for wasting time on it instead of studying. But there was some enjoyment in imagining what I will know in the future.</p>
<p>Another result was I formulated a concrete "endgame" for this endeavor. There are 6 courses in a physics minor in my old university:
- mechanics
- electricity and magnetism
- thermodynamics and statistical mechanics
- analytical mechanics
- waves
- quantum mechanics
I think it would be cool to learn them all from the kind of books I like, which are harder but deeper. This is quite a long term thing, I extrapolate that on this pace it would take at least a year and a half. If I prioritize according to what seems to me most interesting and important for understanding the world, then that reduces to electricity and thermodynamics. Specifically statistical mechanics ideas are relevant to math and machine learning, but I feel electricity should be learned beforehand.</p>
<p>Okay, let's move on to the book.</p>
