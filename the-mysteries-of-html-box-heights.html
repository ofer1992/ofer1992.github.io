</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Today's post is not "fully cooked", I still don't think I figured this topic out, but I did learn a few things.</p>
<p>Today I needed to do some css hacking for a dashboard I'm building with <code>streamlit</code>. I was using a <code>grid</code> element from the streamlit-extras package, and I wanted to create a card component with a title and description by injection html into the app. I couldn't get the card to fill its square in the grid. Setting <code>height: 100%;</code> didn't help. From looking at the implementation it seemed that the grid elements were each a flex container, but even <code>flex-grow</code> didn't seem to work.</p>
<p>First realization: height percentage only takes the parent's height if it is specified. The rules seem to be quite elaborate, but that's the basic fact.</p>
<p>Second realization: streamlit likes to surround stuff with divs. So even though the grid square was a flex container, between my element there were a couple more divs, some flex containers and some display blocks. Why? beats me. That explained why <code>flex-grow</code> didn't work.</p>
<p>The first solution I found was a hack that used <code>::before</code> pseudo-element, padding and absolute positioning. It worked, but it was an ugly truth. After some more digging I found a newer property (2021) called <code>aspect-ratio</code> which conveniently does exactly what I wanted: keep the block square. It's sad though that it wasn't the first result on google.</p>
<p>So what did I learn? height is tricky? not sure, but it's interesting enough to note down. In the future, I need to up my web debugging game.</p>
<p>Anyway, that ended this tale, but many other woes followed, from which I will spare you, dear reader.</p>
