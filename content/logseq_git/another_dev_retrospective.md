I had reached a milestone today in my project to integrate git into the mobile version of logseq. Finally the git functions like add, status, init were working. I also realized that all the work and time that I put in so far was to writh this file system adapter that would fit the `fs` api requirements defined by isomorphic git. I ask myself why did it take so long, and what were my failure points. I want to see how I could do better in the future.
