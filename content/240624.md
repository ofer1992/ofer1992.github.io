## what's up with cones?
Worked on this problem today

![[output/images/cones.jpg]]

basically calculate the electric force in the top. Theres a symmetry we can use, where each point's horizontal force contribution is cancelled out by a point across. Hence the force along a horizontal ring is constant, and once we figure it out we can integrate over the rings.
