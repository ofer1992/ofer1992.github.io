## Introduction 

Lately I've been brushing up on my *Measure Theory*. I took the course in my senior year, excited to finally learn the proper foundation for probability theory, but I was soon disappointed by what seemed to be as mostly an exercise in formality. Seeing as how I was also somewhat fatigued of studying at this point, I sufficed with passing the grade with a decent grade and promptly forgot everything I learned. After some time though, it started to irritate me that I went through all this trouble and yet I get nervous when I read about measures. Even from a course like topology whose majority of results I also forgot still contributed to me later. 

So, I finally set out on a refresher. I found a book, "Probability and Stochastics" by Erhan Ã‡inlar, which purpoted to cover probabilty from a measure-theoretic perspective, along with a whole chapter devoted specifically to the those measure theory subjects relevant to probability. I read them quite dilligently, with some of the material still being familiar enough to be covered quickly, while later subjects required more deliberate effort. After a month or so, I felt I had good a solid grasp on the ideas, but still I felt a tinge of fear that soon it will all be forgotten again. That is why I have decided to write one or more posts about aspects that I find interesting to ponder, process and share with you.
